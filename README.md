# UnblockConf 2022 Presentations - Supporting Material

Hi all,

Thanks for joining my two sessions from UnblockConf 2022.  This repo contains all the pipeline files, scripts, and other supporting material in case you wish to revisit what was shown.

I have made the demo pipelines public:

## Build Annotations
A pipeline with some fancy annotations

A pipeline that creates annotations that link back to individual steps (I forgot to show this one in the session - d'oh)
